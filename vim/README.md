# vim

From micro you can switch to vim, i.e. you can edit
the current file in vim. When you quit vim, you
get back to micro.

## Rationale

It can happen that you can do something in vim easier.
For instance, you want to edit several lines with
a complicated macro. In that case, you switch quickly to vim,
do the job, and then get back to micro.

## Requirements

By default it calls `nvim`.

## Usage

Issue the following command:

    > vim
