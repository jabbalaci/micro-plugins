# micro plugins

Some useful plugins for the [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/index.html) text editor.

Some of these plugins were written by me and some of them
are from others. Credits are given everywhere.

You can get a list of installable plugins here: https://micro-editor.github.io/plugins.html

At the moment, my plugins are not registered in the
plugins channel, thus they are not installable
from micro. If you need these plugins, you'll have to
download and copy them to `~/.config/micro/plug` .
